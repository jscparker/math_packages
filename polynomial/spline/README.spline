Package Spline provides routines for generating cubic spline fits to
arbitrarily spaced data points, along with routines for interpolation,
integration, and differentiation of the spline.

Package Tridiagonal_LU implements Crout's method for LU decomposition
of tri-diagonal matrices and linear equation solving. Tridiagonal_LU
supports package Spline.
