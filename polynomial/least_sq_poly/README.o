Package Orthogonal_Polys provides routines that generate Gram-Schmidt
orthogonal polynomials on arbitrarily spaced discrete grid points. The
package also provides a routine for high order polynomial least-squares
curve fitting.

Procedures Opolys_tst_1 and Opolys_tst_2 demonstrate high
order least squares polynomial fitting.
